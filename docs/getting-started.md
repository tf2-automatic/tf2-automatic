# Getting started

TF2 Automatic is a platform for building trading bots. This project is made up of different applications and libraries. Some of the libraries are internal, and others are published on GitHub packages. The applications are packaged into Docker images and published to the GitHub container registry. All packages can be found [here](https://github.com/orgs/tf2-automatic/packages?repo_name=tf2-automatic). This is not a single application with all batteries included. It is a collection of applications and libraries that can be used to create your own trading bots, or complicated trading bot networks.
